EXPLAINING THE TERRAFORM PROJECT

Terrafrom was used in this project to create an aws instance (ubuntu) in multiple regions (free-tier) (eu-west-1(dev) and eu-central-1(production)
The project was build on minimum of 2 availablity zones and its reuseable.
terraform plan -var-file has a file that ends with the extension tfvars (dev.tfvars and prod.tfvars). It was built on multiple environments (dev, prod) and it has a script that creates ansible, docker container 
 The assignment scripts is modularized 

Variables: this will allow us to centralize and manage values in our configurations

RESOURSCES:       
Resources in this project are the most important languages in Terraform. Resources would allow you provision different resources in your infrastructure.
 resource "aws_instance" "base" { output values (id, name)
            ami = var.ami
            instance_type ="t2_micro"
        resource "aws_instance

MODULES:
modules in this project are defined with the module blocks and they are ways of constructing reuseable boundles of resources,
which will allow you to organize collections of terraform codes which you can share across multiple configurations.
